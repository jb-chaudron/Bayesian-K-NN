## General Informations
Project due for the midterm of "Informatique et Progammation" (Computer Science and Programmation) took in Lyon II, in March 2020 and overseen by Alexandre Bluet.

## Aim and Design of the project
The original task was to write a K-NN from scratch in Python.
Nonetheless, I added a Bayesian inference part to my project, aiming to correct imbalanced dataset and increase the accuracy of the model.

## Technologies
*Python
